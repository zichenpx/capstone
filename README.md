# Capstone/ Casting Agency project (Full Stack Project)

The Capstone/ Casting Agency project, a final project of Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program of Udacity, is an application that you can practice full stack skills.

Live on:
https://tranquil-ridge-30288.herokuapp.com/

P.S.: If the website didn't work, feel free to contact me, and it may also means that I stop the app for some reasons.

## 1. Motivations

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1. Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.9

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Environment

Working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects is recommended. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform are the following:

Initialize and activate a virtualenv:

```bash
$ cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_PATH/
$ python -m venv env
$ env/Scripts/activate
```

More instructions can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages this project selected within the `requirements.txt` file. Furthermore, it is better to use pip3 for python3 because on some systems pip is mapped with python2. However, pip is working for me, I am not going to hide it and providing it as another way for you. Maybe pip3 did not work with you, yet pip did!

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. Since we want you to focus on auth, we handle the heavy lift for you in `./src/database/models.py`. We recommend skimming this code first so you know how to interface with the Drink model.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

- [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Flask-Migrate is an extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic. The database operations are made available through the Flask command-line interface.

- [Flask-Script](https://flask-script.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) The Flask-Script extension provides support for writing external scripts in Flask. This includes running a development server, a customised Python shell, scripts to set up your database, cronjobs, and other command-line tasks that belong outside the web application itself.

- [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/blob/master/README.md) Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into [`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_env). Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config) methodology.

- [Auth](https://pypi.org/project/auth/) Auth is a module that makes authorization simple and also scalable and powerful. It also has a beautiful RESTful API for use in micro-service architectures and platforms.

- [Flask-Cors](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Cors/) A Flask extension for handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making cross-origin AJAX possible.This package has a simple philosophy: when you want to enable CORS, you wish to enable it for all use cases on a domain. This means no mucking around with different allowed headers, methods, etc.

- [urllib.request](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html) The urllib.request module defines functions and classes which help in opening URLs (mostly HTTP) in a complex world â€” basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies and more. See also The [Requests package](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) is recommended for a higher-level HTTP client interface.

- [functools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html) The functools module is for higher-order functions: functions that act on or return other functions. In general, any callable object can be treated as a function for the purposes of this module. Also, you can refer to [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functools-module-in-python/) for more information.

- [werkzeug.datastructures](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/datastructures/) Werkzeug provides some subclasses of common Python objects to extend them with additional features. Some of them are used to make them immutable, others are used to change some semantics to better work with HTTP.

### 3.2. Running the server

From within the root directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server on Linux system, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run --reload
```

or

```bash
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

To run the server on Windows system, execute:

```bash
set FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

P.S.: the `export` command works with me, though I developed in Windows system, and used [Hyper Terminal](https://hyper.is/), for your information. Another good external command interfaces(terminal) recommended are [Git Bash for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and [Cmder | Console Emulator](https://cmder.net/) due to some reason might be a Windows related issue.

## 4. API Reference

### 4.1. Getting Started

Base URL: At present this app can be run locally and may not be hosted as a base URL. If hosted, the hosted version is at https://tranquil-ridge-30288.herokuapp.com/. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

Authentication: This application requires authentication to perform various actions. All the endpoints require various permissions, except the root (or health) endpoint, that are passed via the Bearer token.

The application has two types of roles:

- Agency:

  - can view the list of artist and movies and can view complete information for any actor or movie
  - can also create an actor and movie and also modify respective information
  - can also delete an actor or a movie
  - has `get:movies, get:movies-detail, post:movie, patch:movie, delete:movie, get:actors, get:actors-detail, post:actor, patch:actor, delete:actor` permissions

- User

  - can only view the list of artist and movies and can view complete information for any actor or movie
  - has `get:movies, get:movies-detail, get:actors, get:actors-detail` permissions

### 4.2. Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```json
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 404,
    "message": "resource not found"
}
```

The API will return these error types when requests fail:

- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 422: Not Processable
- 500: Internal Server Error

### 4.3. Endpoints

#### GET /

- A public root endpoint, no authentication required, can also check if the API is running or not.

##### Sample Request

`http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## 5. Testing

There two test files - one for role agency, one for role user.

For testing the backend.To run the agency test, run

```bash
dropdb capstone_test
createdb capstone_test
psql -U postgres capstone_test < capstone.sql
OR psql capstone_test < capstone_no_owner.sql
python test_app_agency.py
```

To run the user test, run

```bash
dropdb capstone_test
createdb capstone_test
psql -U postgres capstone_test < capstone.sql
OR psql capstone_test < capstone_no_owner.sql
python test_app_user.py
```

## 6. Deploy to Heroku

### 6.1 Generally

- Assuems that you have:

  - a free [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/dc).
  - Python version 3.10 installed locally - see the installation guides for [OS X](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/), [Windows](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/win/), and [Linux](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/).
  - [Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup) installed locally, if running the app locally.

### 6.2 Heroku CLI

- Use the `heroku login` command to log in to the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

### 6.3 Create app on the Heroku

**_ Before continuing, make sure both Git and the Heroku CLI are installed (see [Set up](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python?singlepage=true#set-up)). _**

- Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code:

  ```bash
  heroku create
  ```

  or specify your app name

  ```bash
  heroku create [your_app_name]
  ```

- Add git remote for Heroku to local repository
  -Using the git url obtained from the last step, in terminal run:

  ```bash
  git remote add heroku heroku_git_url.
  ```

- Deploy your code:

  ```bash
  git push heroku main
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  git push heroku master
  ```

The creation and deployment can be implemented on Heroku dashboard by logging in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

For more information, refer to [Getting Started on Heroku with Python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python?singlepage=true).

### 6.4 [Add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons)

- Database

  - You can choose to use [Heroku Postgres](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql), then you need add-ons. You can implement this step in [here](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) by clicking "Install Heroku Postgres".
  - Or execute:

  ```bash
  heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --app name_of_your_application
  ```

  - Breaking down the `heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` section of this command, heroku-postgresql is the name of the addon. `hobby-dev` on the other hand specifies the tier of the addon, in this case the free version which has a limit on the amount of data it will store, albeit fairly high.
  - Run `heroku config --app name_of_your_application` in order to check your configuration variables in Heroku. You will see DATABASE_URL and the URL of the database you just created. That's excellent, but there were a lot more environment variables our apps use.

### 6.5 Importing Heroku Postgres Databases

There are two ways to importing Heroku Postgres Database. First one is recommended in official documentation. Second one is what I found.

- Method 1: [Import Heroku Postgres via AWS S3](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-import-export)

  - Create dump file

  ```bash
  pg_dump -Fc --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U myuser mydb > mydb.dump
  ```

  - [S3 setup](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3#manually-uploading-static-assets)

    - Get [sucurity credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys).

    ```bash
    $ heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=MY-ACCESS-ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=MY-ACCESS-KEY
    ```

    - Create S3 Bucket in AWS
    - Name Your Bucket

      ```bash
      heroku config:set S3_BUCKET_NAME=example-app-assets
      ```

    - Upload your files

  - Import to Heroku Postgres

    - Generate a signed URL using the aws console:

    ```bash
    aws s3 presign s3://your-bucket-address/your-object
    ```

    Use the raw file URL in the pg:backups restore command:

    ```bash
    heroku pg:backups:restore '<SIGNED URL>' DATABASE_URL
    ```

    Any presigned URL or public repo can do the above.

    **_ Note that the pg:backups restore command drops any tables and other database objects before recreating them._**

- Method 2: [Import from local](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57071382/cant-import-to-heroku-postgres-with-aws)

  - Create backup file in .sql

  ```bash
  pg_dump <DATABASE_NAME> > <FILENAME>.sql
  ```

  If you want the database has no owner, you can also try:

  ```bash
  pg_dump --no-owner -U postgres <DATABASE_NAME> > <FILENAME>.sql
  ```

  - Import to Heroku Postgres

    - Generate a signed URL using the aws console:

    ```bash
    heroku pg:psql --app <APP_NAME> < <FILENAME>.sql
    ```

- Run Database Manage & Migration

  - Run locally first
    Install:

    ```bash
    pip install flask_script
    pip install flask_migrate
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

    Execute:

    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
    flask db upgrade
    ```

    \*\*\* It is very important to run migration locally first. Otherwise, it could mess up the app on Heroku. If it happended, you need to create the database from scratch.

  - Run Heroku Database Migration

    - It depends. If needed, execute:

      ```bash
        heroku run python manage.py db upgrade --app name_of_your_application
      ```

      or

      ```bash
      heroku run flask db upgrade
      ```
